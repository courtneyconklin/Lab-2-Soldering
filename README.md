# Lab-2-Soldering
# By: Courtney Conklin

# Summary 
The first goal of this lab was to become familiar with the soldering by using scrap wires, resistors, and other specified components and soldering them to the protoboards. Once familiar with this technique, the robot was assembled by following the given directions, which included soldering some pieces together. Then wires were properly places between the arduino and the breadboard. Finally, the functionality of the robot built was tested by running arduino on the laptop. 
# Materials
2 front motor mounts, 2 rear motor mounts, 2 motors, 2 wheels, a line follower mount, a line follower mount plate, 3 line follower boards, 3 three wire jumper cables, 4 side struts, 1 nub caster, top chassis plate, bottom chassis plate, a battery holder, a battery pack plate, 4 AA batteries, a mini breadboard, a breadboard, power supply stick, TB6612 h-bridge, wires, soldering kit, protoboards. 
# Assembly Procedures 
1. Assembled the soldering iron using the provided instructions. 
2. Practiced soldering scrap wires into the protoboards. 
3. Soldered three resistors side by side in a row. 
4. Began assembling the robot by by placing the rear motor mount over the middle of the motor and repeat for the other motor. 
5. Placed the front motor mount on the front of each of the motors. 
6. Snapednboth of the motors into the horizontal slots on the bottom chassis plate. 
7. Placed each wheel onto the plastic chaft of each motor. Make sure that the flat edges line up with the motor and the wheel. 
8. Next, attached the three line follower boards to the line follower mount. 
9. Placed the line follower mount plate on top of the line follower mount so that the center clip sticks out the center slot of the plate. 
10. Connected a 3 wire jumper cable to each of the line follower boards and followed the connections table on the website. 
11. Attached the line follower to the front of the bottom chassis. 
12. Snapped the nub caster into the slot on the back of the bottom chassis plate.
13. Snapped the four side struts into the diagonal slots on the four corners of the bottom chassis plate.
14. Placed the top chassis plate over the bottom chassis place, without snapping them together, and routed the cables  to the right or left by following the cable table on the instruction website.
15. Installed the battery pack with the batteries on the bottom chassis plate.
16. Snapped the top chassis plate to the bottom chassis plate. 
17. Placed the power supply stick on the half breadboard and then placed the TB6612 h-bridge on the mini breadboard.
18. Stuck the breadboards to the top chassis plate on the robot based on the example robot. 
19. Installed Arduino on the robot. 
20. Followed the wiring chart to connect the components. 
21. Had the TA verify the build of our robot, the wires of the robot, and checked to make sure the robot functioned properly. 
# Test Equipment 
Arduino, computer
# Test Procedure
1. Took the built robot and plugged it into the TA's computer. 
2. Ran Arduino on the computer to make sure the robot functioned properly.   
# Test Results 

# Discussion
Practicing soldering on the scrap materials allowed for me to become comfortable and familiar with this technique and be apply to solder the parts on my robot. I also was able to easily assemble my robot by following the directions. Another tool that I was able learn within this lab was how to read a wiring chart to connect the two components, which was something I had not be exposed to before this lab. Having a properly assembled robot that works with the Aruduino will allow me to be able to complete other labs in the future for this course.
